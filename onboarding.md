### To Read:
- [Product Strategy](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/blob/main/product/strategy/projects.md)
- [Product Principles](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/blob/main/product/strategy/product-principles.md)

- [Team Posts](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/planning-tracking/discussions?pinned=1)
These posts vary from how we think about working, competitive analysis of competitors, to best practices or learnings we‚Äôve found along the way. 
A great way to see how the team has evolved and learn about the types of things we try to write about and share.

- [Prior/Fundamental Research](https://github.com/github/awesome-insights/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Area%3A+I2C-Issues%22)
A trove of research about projects and issues spanning the last 2 years. 
A great place to see if we‚Äôve got early research or signal around a problem/solution and generally learn about how we‚Äôve progressed/iterated.


### Team Resources:
We use [team posts](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/planning-tracking) as way to publish writing to the Planning and Tracking team. They are also a great way for the teams to share their accomplishments and create URLs that can be shared across different groups. It would be worth reading through the history, but here are a few key posts to get started with: 
- [Product principles](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/planning-tracking/posts/63)
- [Gathering feedback](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/planning-tracking/posts/74)
- [Projects analyst feedback](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/planning-tracking/posts/94)
- [Building project management tools for developers](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/planning-tracking/posts/107)
- [Public beta! Projects at Universe](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/planning-tracking/posts/128)
- [What makes a Projects superfan?](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/planning-tracking/posts/130)

### ‚úçÔ∏è Customer notes
We keep and share notes on customer discussions in the [planning and tracking repository](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking) under the [customer feedback](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/tree/main/customer%20feedback) folder. To keep this manageable we segment feedback by phases. Current we are in public beta, you can find all the feedback we have collected since that announcement [here](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/tree/main/customer%20feedback/Projects%20Public%20Beta). 

You can also dive into a ton of history here with feedback from: 

- [Private beta](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/tree/main/customer%20feedback/Projects%20Private%20Beta)
- [Alpha](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/tree/main/customer%20feedback/Memex%20Alpha)
- [Initial concept testing](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/tree/main/customer%20feedback/Memex%20Alpha/Concept%20value%20testing)
- [General feedback](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/tree/main/customer%20feedback/General%20Feedback) (for non-projects related feedback)

### üìà Metrics 
The two main ways of working with metrics at GitHub are Looker and SQL. But this is being expanded all the time and new ways (e.g powerBI) are being introduced. 

10D28 (how many people used projects for 10 days or more in a rolling 28 day period) is our primary metric we talk about a lot. We use this to guide a lot of our decisions as it captures the depth of engagement we are looking for which signals a user is finding value from projects. 
 
Some useful links to get you started:

- [Beta dashboard](https://looker.githubapp.com/dashboards/2200) (Looker) - This is our main dashboard with our north star metrics on it.
- [Features dashboard](https://looker.githubapp.com/dashboards/2505) (Looker) - Deeper dives into individual features
- [Number of users per org](https://data.githubapp.com/sql/share/aa7b6e28) (SQL)
- [Events triggered](https://data.githubapp.com/sql/share/69a94f9a) (SQL) - This is useful for a starting point to dive deeper into individual events 
- [Product 360](https://product360.githubapp.com/?product=Memex&page=Home) - This is an internal dashboard used by the LT team to get an overview of all areas of GitHub.
- [PowerBI](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/46d8ff26-cf62-4a58-bb9a-7d5397791f7f/reports/128e78de-659e-422f-a413-2431241563b8/ReportSection) - This is a PowerBI dashboard that sometimes is used to get a high level overview of all areas of GitHub. You will need to log in with your MSFT account
- [Data at GitHub](https://data.githubapp.com) - This is a starting point to explore how we work with data

(note - our internal SQL tool - datadot - lets you share URLs to pre-run queries. To re-run these queries and get the latest date you will need to fork them first.)  


### üì§ How we work
We work in 6 week cycles (the next one will start Jan 3rd). 

- [FY22 Planning and Tracking](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/3706) - Is our high level backlog for work in progress and upcoming work. 
- [Tracking issues](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Status%3A+GREY%2C+Tracking%3A+Epic&template=epic-tracking-template.md&title=Tracking%3A) - Everything in that project takes the form of a tracking issue 
- [P&T Pitches](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/3580) - We are constantly sourcing pitches from the team of things they are interested in working on that would push the product forward. They can be created [here](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/issues/new?assignees=&labels=pitch&template=pitch.md&title=%5BPitch%5D+)

Each of the squads keeps their own project board which follows the tactical level of work in progress. Some of the projects in progress right now include: 

- [10D28 superfans](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/3236) - A collection of small improvements that we hear from our most active users 
- [Projects parity](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/2826/views/2) - A workstream to get us to parity with the existing ‚Äòprojects classic‚Äô experience
- [Draft Issues](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4634) - Bringing a richer draft issue experience to projects
- [Linked PRs](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4682/views/1) - Integrated PR‚Äôs into projects 

- [Projects First Responder](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4017/views/1) - Used to collect all the in flight and upcoming work for the [first responders](https://github.com/github/planning-tracking/tree/main/docs/first_responder_and_triage) (note - we are in the process of making some changes to this that should go live this week)   

### üó£ Slack
We have a bunch of Slack channels with customers we will invite you to. These are a great way to build relationships and source feedback. We are always looking for more engaged customers to work closely with so if you speak to a team who really get what we are trying to build here it would be great to participate more closely with them.
